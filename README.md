# MongooseCheerios-News-Scrape

Mongo Scraper is a news scraping app that will utilize cheerio.js to scrape data (in this case from The New York Times' "The Daily") in order to append this data into a database via mongoose/MongoDB

Needed Improvements:
-Need to fix the button to actually utilize it to scrape data from "The Daily". As of now, scraping is only done by adding /scrape to end of webpage URL

-Need to add saved articles into database and append it to a "Saved Articles" link
